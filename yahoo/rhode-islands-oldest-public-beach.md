# Rhode Island's oldest public beach opened over 100 years ago. How to go this summer

It's the middle of summer in New England, and what better way is there to cool off than at one of Rhode Island's beaches?

With beautiful coastlines and calm, blue waters, the Ocean State is full of beaches that make for the perfect New England summer day. But which one of the state's beaches is the oldest?

With roots going back to 1887, Newport's Easton's Beach - locally known as First Beach - is the oldest public beach in Rhode Island, standing at 138 years old.

Here's a brief history of the state's oldest beach, as well as how to go there this summer.

## History of Easton's Beach

According to the Newport Historical Society, Easton's Beach dates back to 1887, when architectural firm Peabody & Stearns built the original Pavilion. The beach was named after Nicholas Easton, an early settler of Newport and former colonial governor of Rhode Island.

In 1902, the facilities were expanded to look like a Mediterranean Villa, complete with bath houses, restaurants, a carousel and a roller coaster. The beach soon became a popular summer destination for middle and working-class families, who could walk the boardwalk, rent cabins, ride steamboats and enjoy the amusement rides.

Unfortunately, all of the beach's original buildings were swept away during the Hurricane of 1938. The beach has undergone lots of weather-caused destruction over the years since then, with most of the present structures only standing since 1992. In 2004, the snack bar and carousel were demolished.

Today, First Beach remains one of the most popular attractions in Newport, offering easy access to the Cliff Walk, a board walk and plenty of historical charm.
